#  Key insights and Recommedations
## Here are key insights & recommendation from the data as shown on the dashboard;
- ADMISSION BY AGE GROUP: age group of 65years & above is the most admitted age group,
health care facilities may need to enhance health services and invest in specialized training for staffs.

- MOST COMMON MEDICAL CONDITION: Arthritis is the most common medical condition among admitted patients ,
this tells us that healthcare providers prioritize their efforts in prevention and treatment of Arthritis

- AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY BY MEDICAL CONDITION: this is a key performance indicator that reflects the efficiency of care delivery,
 it is shown that patients with Asthma spends an average of 15.7days in healthcare facilities which signals inefficiencies in treatment protocols.
 this information can be used to implement best practices that streamline care process , reduce average time spent and ultimately lower cost

- MOST FREQUENT ADMISSION TYPE: elective admissions is most frequent admission type , healthcare facilities may need to evaluate their
elective room resources & staffing levels to reduce waiting times & improve patient outcomes.

- RATE OF ADMISSION PER YEAR: viewing the trend on the line chart up to this current year we can clearly see that there is a significant
drop in admission rate in the year 2024 which indicates successful changes in health care access.
